Find SSRs in FASTA sequence data 

Input:

  -b, -bi, -BI, --bzipped2-input
			Input fasta file is compressed with bzip2. If the file
			name supplied to '-i' ends in '.bz2', the input is
			assumed to be compressed with bzip2, regardless of
			whether you supplied this option or not. If the
			compressed file is supplied via STDIN, you should (a)
			use the bzcat utility (part of the bzip2 package) and
			(b) not use '-b'.

  -g, -gi, -GI, --gzipped-input
			Input fasta file is gzipped. If the file name supplied
			to '-i' ends in '.gz', the input is assumed to be
			gzipped, regardless of whether you supplied this
			option or not. If the compressed file is supplied via
			STDIN, you should (a) use the zcat utility (part of
			the gzip package) and (b) not use '-g'.

  -i in.fasta[.gz|.bz2], --input in.fasta[.gz|.bz2]
			The input file in fasta format, may be compressed with
			gzip or bzip2 (see '-g' and '-b'). All sequence
			characters will be converted to uppercase. [default:
			stdin]

Output:

  -B, -bo, -BO, --bzip2-output
			Compress the output file with bzip2. This will *not*
			automatically add '.bz2' to the end of any file name
			supplied by '-o'. If the file name supplied to '-o'
			already ends in '.bz2', the output will be compressed
			with bzip2, regardless of whether you supplied this
			option or not. If the '-o' option is not used, use
			this flag to compress everything sent to stdout with
			bzip2.

  -G, -go, -GO, --gzip-output
			Gzip the output file. This will *not* automatically
			add '.gz' to the end of any file name supplied by
			'-o'. If the file name supplied to '-o' already ends
			in '.gz', the output will be gzipped, regardless of
			whether you supplied this option or not. If the '-o'
			option is not used, use this flag to gzip everything
			sent to stdout.

  -o out.tsv[.gz|.bz2], --output out.tsv[.gz|.bz2]
			The output file in tab-separated value (tsv) format,
			may be compressed with gzip or bzip2 (see '-G' and
			'-B'). [default: stdout]

Algorithmic:

  -a a1,..,aN, --alphabet a1,..,aN
			A comma-separated list of valid, uppercase characters
			(nucleotides). [default=A,C,G,T]

  -A, --allow-non-atomic
			Report non-atomic SSRs (e.g., AT repeated 6 times will
			also report an ATAT repeated 3 times and an ATATAT
			repeated 2 times).

  -e, --exhaustive      Disable all filters and SSR validation to report every
			SSR. Similar to: -A -r 2 -R <big_number> -n 2 -N
			<big_number>. This will override any options set for
			-n, -N, -r, -R, and -s.

  -p p1,..,pN, --periods p1,..,pN
			A comma-separated list of period sizes (i.e., kmer
			lengths). Inclusive ranges are also supported using a
			hyphen. [default=4-6]

  -n int, --min-nucleotides int
			Keep only SSRs with total length (number of
			nucleotides) >= n [default: 2]

  -N int, --max-nucleotides int
			Keep only SSRs with total length (number of
			nucleotides) <= N [default: 10,000]

  -r int, --min-repeats int
			Keep only SSRs that repeat >= r times [default: 2]

  -R int, --max-repeats int
			Keep only SSRs that repeat <= R times [default:
			10,000]

  -s s1,..,sN, --ssrs s1,..,sN
			A comma-separated list of SSRs to search for; e.g.
			\"AC,GTTA,TTCTG,CCG\" or \"TGA\". Please note that other
			options may prevent SSRs specified with this option
			from appearing in the output. For example, if -p is
			\"4-6\", then an SSR with a repeating \"AC\" will never be
			displayed because \"AC\" has a period size of 2 (and, as
			it turns out, 2 is not in the range 4-6).

Misc:

  -d, --disable-progress-bar
			Disable the progress bar that normally prints to
			stderr. Will automatically be disabled if (a) reading
			from stdin or (b) writing to stdout without
			redirecting it to a file.

  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit

  -Q int, --max-task-queue-size int
			[default: 1,000]

  -t int, --threads int
			Number of threads [default: 1]

  -v, --version         Show version number and exit
