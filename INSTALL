INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

COMPILE
-------
Simply type `make'.  The binary will be in the `bin' directory.


INSTALL
-------
Type `make' followed by `make install'.  The binary will be in both the `bin'
and `/usr/local/bin' directories.  To change the installation location, change
the `PREFIX' variable near the top of `Makefile'.  


UNINSTALL
---------
Simply type `make clean'.  This will remove the binary in the `bin' directory.
If you installed with `make install', it will also remove the binary at the
path provided by the `PREFIX' variable in the `Makefile'.

The object (.o) files in the `obj' directory will not be deleted. To remove
those files as well, type `make realclean'. If you use `make realclean', you
need not first type `make clean' as it will do it for you. Running `make
realclean' will also remove the `bin' and `obj' directories.


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
Your compiler must support C++11.
